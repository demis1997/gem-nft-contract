### Description

The project is an NFT collection and marketplace featuring Gems, which rewards users with monetary value through staking TON. Users interact with a game-like interface to mine new Gems, as well as to buy, sell, and burn them. Additionally, users can forge two Gems to obtain a rarer Gem. Users can deposit WTON on Layer 1 (L1) and receive a wrapped version called WSTON on L2. Users utilize L2 WSTON to buy GEMs at a discount price.

When a user wishes to acquire a new Gem from the pre-mined pool, the token is assigned randomly using the VDF verifier implementation.
